Continuous Dynamical Systems Tutorial
=====================================

This tutorial provides an introduction to using **pynamicalsys** for continuous dynamical systems. It covers the usage of built-in system and the creation of custom systems, running simulations, and visualizing results.

This tutorial is also available as a Jupyter notebook. You can `download it <_static/continuous_dynamical_system_tutorial.ipynb>`_ or view it directly in your `browser <https://github.com/mrolims/pynamicalsys/blob/main/docs/source/_static/continuous_dynamical_system_tutorial.ipynb>`_.
